## About Me

JB is a PhD student in the McGill University Sociology Department and a member of the Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship (CSDC). Prior to attending McGill, JB completed an MSc in Social Research Methods at the London School of Economics, after which he worked as a researcher with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago.   

JB’s current research explores the cultural implications of migration, the role of collective memory in shaping national and ethnic identities, and the evolution of “personal culture” across the life course. Although a methodological pluralist, JB primarily draws on quantitative methods, including various regression-based techniques and relational approaches like correspondence and network analysis. His research is funded by the Fonds de Recherche du Quebec (FRQSC).
