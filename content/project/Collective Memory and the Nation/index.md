In this paper, I explore the relationship between collective memory and migrant integration against the backdrop of state-endorsed culture and nation-building efforts. Theoretically, I play with the idea of culture—specifically memory culture—as a phenomenon that exists internally in the form of “personal culture” as knowledge, attitudes, and orientations about the social world, and in the form of “public culture” paying particular attention to state-endorsed culture (“official culture”). Based on findings from a series of random- and fixed-effects models that draw on data from a longitudinal survey of German youth, I make the case that official culture plays a unique (heavy handed) role in the integration process. My findings demonstrate how, in some cases, immigrants use official cultural scripts as a way to make claims to the national community.
