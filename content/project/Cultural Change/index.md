In this co-authored piece, we explore the evolution of cultural change, comparing across those with and without a migration background in Germany. We use a variance decomposition technique to measure cultural change, after which we run a series of regressions to model the magnitude of change within generational sub-samples (e.g., first generation, second generation, and so on). Our analyses show the greatest change among "natives" followed by the third generation, second generation, and first generation, respectively. Our findings suggest that part of the acculturation process involves "unlocking" the capcity for change while also highlight the mercurial nature of the proverbial cultural "mainstream".
