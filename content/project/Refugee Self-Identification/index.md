This paper takes as its point of entry the notion that "refugee" begins as a formal legal category and then evolves into an informal social label. To do so, we draw on a nationally representative survey of Syrian refugees resettled to Canada. Our variable of interest is a question that asked respondents about the frequency with which they self-identify as a refugee when meeting new people, which we explore both cross-sectionally and over two time points. Our results suggest that respondent social networks and experiences of belonging and discrimination are the best predictors of disclosure behavior. In contrast, employment related measures do not appear to have much of an impact.
